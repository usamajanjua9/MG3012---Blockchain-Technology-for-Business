## üìå Course Description

This course introduces students to the transformative potential of blockchain technology in business environments, especially in the FinTech domain. Students begin with Python programming fundamentals, then explore blockchain concepts such as distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms, and cryptography. Hands-on development includes writing smart contracts in Solidity, deploying dApps using tools like MetaMask, Remix, Truffle, and Ganache, and applying blockchain to real-world business use cases.

Key domains include:

* Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
* Tokenization & Stablecoins
* Digital Identity & KYC automation
* Blockchain Governance & DAOs
* Security, Privacy & Layer-2 solutions

The course blends **theory + labs + case studies + projects**, ensuring students not only build technical skills but also understand compliance, ethics, and innovation in blockchain systems.
