        "\n",
        "> To borrow 100 dollars of DAI, you might have to lock up $150 of ETH.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "If the **value of collateral** drops below a certain **threshold**, the system automatically **liquidates** it (sells it to repay the loan).\n",

        "### ⚙️ The Liquidation Process\n",

        "2. If a loan’s ratio falls below the threshold:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Collateral is automatically sold or auctioned.\n",

        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A property is legally placed under a company or custodian.\n",
        "2. That ownership is **divided into tokens** on the blockchain (e.g., 100,000 tokens).\n",
        "3. Investors buy the tokens → fractional ownership.\n",
        "4. Rental income or profits can be shared automatically via smart contracts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* [RealT](https://realt.co/) – Tokenized real estate properties in the US.\n",
        "* Brickblock – Tokenized property investing platform.\n",

        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* No need for huge capital to invest.\n",
        "* No paperwork.\n",
        "* Immediate global resale options.\n",

        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A piece of valuable artwork is evaluated and digitized.\n",
        "2. The ownership is divided into NFTs or tokens.\n",
        "3. Investors own **fractions of famous paintings**, and even earn if they’re auctioned.\n",

        "* [Maecenas](https://www.maecenas.co/) – Tokenizes fine art.\n",

        "#### 🥇 C. Commodities Tokenization (e.g., Gold, Oil)\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Gold is stored in a vault by a trusted company.\n",
        "2. A token (like 1 token = 1 gram of gold) is issued.\n",
        "3. The token can be traded or even **redeemed for physical gold**.\n",

        "**Examples:**\n",

        "* **PAX Gold (PAXG)** – Each token = 1 ounce of real gold.\n",
        "* **Tether Gold (XAUT)** – Gold-backed tokens with physical redemption option.\n",

        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Easy access to global commodities.\n",
        "* No need to physically store gold/oil.\n",
        "* Trade small amounts like 0.1g of gold.\n",
