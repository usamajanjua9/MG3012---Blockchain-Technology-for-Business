        "   *Example: Ethereum Merge (PoW → PoS) was a result of governance proposals.*\n",
        "2. **Conflict Resolution** – Decides how to respond to bugs or hacks (e.g., Ethereum DAO hack fork in 2016).\n",
        "3. **Economic Stability** – Adjusts parameters like fees, collateral ratios, or inflation.\n",
        "4. **Community Representation** – Lets users influence the future of the network.\n",
        "5. **Security** – Prevents malicious control by ensuring transparent decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Scenario:**\n",
        "Imagine a DeFi project needs to change its interest rate model.\n",
